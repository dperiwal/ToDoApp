Repository for CodePath ToDoList assignment

By Damodar Periwal

This initial implementation of the ToDOList assignment has support for the following features:

- Adding a new item using an EditText view and a Button control
- Deleting an item with a long click
- Editing an item with a click
- Saving (persisting) items in a local file
- Restoring previously persisted items when the app is restarted

The file DamodarToDoApp1.gif shows the working of the app in the emulator.
