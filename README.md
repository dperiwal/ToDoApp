Repository for CodePath ToDoList assignment

By Damodar Periwal

Made the following enhancements to the basic ToDoList app:

- Added Priority field for a ToDo item; created a model ToDoItem class to hold information about a ToDo item.

- Enhanced display of the list of ToDo itmes to include an additional column for priorites.

- Added column headings for Name and Priority.

- Support for specifying a priority value when adding a new ToDo item.

- Support for editing the priority value for an existing ToDo item.

- Automating sorting of the ToDo items in a list based on the priority value (higher to lower).

- Support for persisting and restoring priority values along with the names of the current ToDo items using a file.

- The file DamodarToDoApp2.gif shows the working of the enhanced app in the emulator.
 

This initial implementation of the ToDOList assignment has support for the following features:

- Adding a new item using an EditText view and a Button control
- Deleting an item with a long click
- Editing an item with a click
- Saving (persisting) items in a local file
- Restoring previously persisted items when the app is restarted

The file DamodarToDoApp1.gif shows the working of the app in the emulator.
